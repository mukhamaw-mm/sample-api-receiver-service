## ‚ö°Ô∏èAbout The Project
This is the rest API receiver project for creating many types of API endpoints.
This is demo project and so, I don't add any other logic like communication with db, etc. So, you will see hard coded values in service class.
You can also learn calling that many types of API endpoints from other services in here SampleAPI Caller Service.
You can learn many types of creating API endpoints in this project like below,
1. Creating sample request APIs
2. Creating sample response APIs
3. Creating sample request and response APIs (this is the main point and to learn that APIs, you need to learn above step 1 and 2 first)
4. Creating sample error response APIs (this is for sample error response)
